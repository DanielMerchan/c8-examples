# Camunda 8 Examples
This repository contains multiple projects for learning or solving different use cases you may encounter with Camunda 8

## Camunda 8 environment for development
Choose your favourite local development environment between:
- [C8 Run](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/c8run/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/docker-compose/)
- [Local Kubernetes Cluster](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/setup/deploy/local/local-kubernetes-cluster/)

I totally recommend C8 Run or Docker Compose for faster and reliable local development environment.

A local kubernetes cluster is a bit an _"overkill"_

If you struggle setting up a local environment, check my blogpost:
